Basic demonstration project for a primitive OpenGL graphics engine
==================================================================

This small program was the environment, where I taught myself the basics of
OpenGL programming. As such, it is far from perfect, but can illustrate some
basic concepts and techniques in 3D computer graphics.

There are multiple types of 3D objects, that the software can draw: spheres,
cylinders, rectangles, and Wavefront OBJ models. The model used as demonstration
for the latter is the Stanford Bunny. There are two usable fragment shaders
included in the project. One is for Phong shading, which looks almost lifelie,
and one for non-photorealistic (NPR) shading, which looks like old comics.

You can move around in the 3D space with the W and S keys, look around with
the mouse, reset your position with the R key, or quit with the Q key. Holding
Shift causes the camera to move slower.

The project exists purely for academic and demonstrational purposes.
